100W Amplifier Companion for the Hermes-Lite 2.x
================================================

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mathisschmieder/HL2-MRF101/wiki) for details.

This is a work in progress to create a 100W power amplifier companion board for the [Hermes-Lite 2.x](http://www.hermeslite.com) using the NXP MRF101 MOSFET. It is based on WA2EUJ's [Single NXP MRF-101 Eval Board](https://sites.google.com/site/rfpowertools/) that won 1st place in the NXP Design Challenge.

First builds of revision 0.2 are successful. Several changes and additions were done by M5EVT to revision 0.3 and boards of that revision are currently being built and tested. See the Wiki for further links and details.
